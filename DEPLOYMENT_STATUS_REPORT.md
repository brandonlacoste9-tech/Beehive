## Target PRs Status 🎯

### Critical Blocker: 4 PRs with Failing Netlify Deploys

| PR | Title | Branch Status | Action Needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| #38 | Copilot Instructions | ✅ Up-to-date with main | Verify Netlify passes |
| #32 | Revert CodeQL | ⏳ Branch update in progress | Awaiting completion |
| #7 | @types/node Bump | ⏳ Branch update in progress | Awaiting completion |
| #4 | @netlify/blobs Bump | ⏳ Branch update in progress | Awaiting completion |

**Current Blocker:** PRs #32, #7, #4 need their branches updated to include latest main changes

### Why These 4 PRs?
These PRs were created before recent critical fixes:
- Home page & root layout restoration
- TypeScript path alias resolution (tsconfig baseUrl)
- API validation utilities
- Phase 2.1 AI Creative Engine

Without these changes, their builds fail on Netlify.

### Solution
Each PR needs to be rebased on main:
```bash
# For each PR branch:
git fetch origin
git checkout <pr-branch-name>
git rebase origin/main
# [Resolve conflicts if any]
git push --force-with-lease origin <pr-branch-name>
```

## PR Consolidation Plan

Once 4 critical PRs are fixed, execute 6-phase consolidation:

### Phase 1: Duplicate Resolution
- Close PR #33 (duplicate of #32)
- Review #24 vs #25 (both CI/CD)

### Phase 2: Merge Infrastructure & Features (5 PRs)
- #25: CI/CD with security
- #36: /status telemetry page
- #22: Phase-2 AI features
- #19: Beehive integration
- #18: Telemetry/codex fixes

### Phase 3: Merge Documentation (6 PRs)
- #14: CODEOWNERS
- #13: Codex docs
- #11: Codex artifacts
- #16: README
- #38: Copilot instructions
- #15: JSON helpers

### Phase 4: Auto-Merge Dependencies (2 PRs)
- #4: @netlify/blobs
- #7: @types/node

### Phase 5: Close Non-Critical (3 PRs)
- #12: Beehive script (redundant)
- #21: npm publishing (deferred)
- #23: CodeQL (reverted)

### Phase 6: Monitor WIP
- #9: Sensory Cortex (check in 1 week)

**Expected Outcome:** 20+ PRs → 2 open PRs (only #9 WIP)

## Immediate Action Items

### ⏳ Step 1: Verify 4 PR Branch Updates
Check Netlify deploy preview status for:
- [ ] PR #38 - Should show green ✅ (already up-to-date)
- [ ] PR #32 - Awaiting green ✅ (branch update in progress)
- [ ] PR #7 - Awaiting green ✅ (branch update in progress)
- [ ] PR #4 - Awaiting green ✅ (branch update in progress)

**Success Criteria:** All 4 show green Netlify deploy checkmarks

### ✅ Step 2: Execute PR Consolidation
Once all 4 are green, run consolidation commands:
```bash
# See PR_CONSOLIDATION_EXECUTION_PLAN.md for full sequence
# Quick version:
gh pr close 33 -c "Duplicate of #32"
gh pr merge 25 --auto --delete-branch
gh pr merge 36 --auto --delete-branch
# ... [18 more commands - see execution plan]
```

### 🎉 Step 3: Begin Phase 2.2
Once consolidation complete:
- Start Serverless Publishing Pipeline
- Implement Instagram/TikTok/YouTube integrations
- Add autonomous scheduling
