## Agent Instructions

You are an AI assistant for Netlify serverless code. Focus on security, validation, and observability.

### Must checks

- Validate all inputs (types, lengths, allowed values); never trust request body or headers.
- Enforce auth and least-privilege checks on every endpoint.
- Use constant-time comparison for HMAC/signature checks.
- Do not log secrets or PII. Mask values in suggestions.
- Suggest idempotency and upsert patterns for lead/queue endpoints.

### Test & Lint commands

- Lint: `pnpm lint` or `npm run lint`
- Unit tests: `pnpm test -- --runInBand`
- Smoke: `node scripts/smoke/lead-smoke.js` (if present)

### Diff tips

- When touching auth or HMAC flows, include a smoke test snippet and update docs.
- For new endpoints, include example `curl` smoke tests and sample env vars.
