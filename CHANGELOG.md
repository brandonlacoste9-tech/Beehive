## [Unreleased]

### Infrastructure

#### Static Export Deployment

**Date**: 2025-10-11

BeeHive has undergone a sacred transformation from Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to **static export** deployment. This architectural rite ensures the Hive's essence can be distilled into pure, immutable artifacts that can be served from any edge of the web.

**What Changed**:
- Migration from dynamic SSR to Next.js static export (`output: 'export'`)
- Build output optimized for static hosting on Netlify, Vercel, or any CDN
- Deployment process simplified to pure static file distribution
- Enhanced performance through pre-rendered pages and reduced server overhead

**Why This Matters**:
- **Performance**: Static pages load instantly, with no server processing delay
- **Scalability**: The Hive can now serve infinite concurrent users without server strain
- **Reliability**: No server means no server downtime—the Hive's knowledge persists eternally
- **Cost**: Reduced infrastructure costs by eliminating server runtime requirements
- **Portability**: Static exports can be hosted anywhere, ensuring the Hive's longevity

**Impact**:
- Faster page loads for all visitors
- Improved SEO through consistent, cacheable content
- Simplified deployment pipeline
- Greater resilience and disaster recovery

This rite strengthens the foundation upon which the Hive's collective intelligence is built.
