## Summary

This PR fixes a critical issue blocking all git operations on Windows by removing a corrupted workflow file with an invalid path.

### Problem
The `main` branch contained a corrupted file structure:
```
.github/workflows/- name: Cache   uses: actions/.../cache@v4.3.0
```

This invalid filename prevented:
- ‚ùå Checking out `main` branch on Windows
- ‚ùå Creating PRs (no common ancestor error)
- ‚ùå Rebasing branches
- ‚ùå Any git operations touching the workflows directory

### Solution
- ‚úÖ Removed the corrupted nested directory structure using GitHub API
- ‚úÖ Preserved all valid workflow files
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive fix scripts for future reference
- ‚úÖ Documented the issue and resolution strategy

### Changes in This PR

#### Fixed Files
- Removed: `.github/workflows/- name: Cache   uses: actions/.../cache@v4.3.0` (corrupted path)

#### New Documentation & Scripts
- `scripts/fix-corrupted-main.ps1` - PowerShell script for GitHub API fix
- `scripts/fix-corrupted-main-v2.ps1` - Improved version with better error handling
- `scripts/fix-corrupted-file-simple.sh` - Bash alternative
- `scripts/delete-corrupted-via-api.ps1` - Direct deletion via contents API
- `scripts/manual-fix-guide.md` - Comprehensive manual fix guide
- `scripts/recover-webhook-automation.sh` - Recovery script for interrupted PRs

### Root Cause
The corrupted file likely originated from:
- Copy-paste error during workflow editing
- Interrupted git operation
- Merge conflict creating malformed filename

Windows filesystems reject paths with certain characters, which is why this specifically broke Windows git operations.

### Verification

**Before fix:**
```bash
git ls-tree -r origin/main | grep "Cache"
# Returns: corrupted path with invalid name
```

**After fix:**
```bash
git ls-tree -r origin/main | grep "Cache"
# Returns: (empty - no corrupted files)
```

### Testing

- [x] Verified corrupted file removed from tree
- [x] All valid workflow files preserved
- [x] Can now checkout main on Windows
- [x] CI workflows still function correctly
- [x] Branch rebases work normally

### Impact

**Fixes:**
- Unblocks all git operations on Windows
- Enables PR creation from feature branches
- Restores ability to rebase onto main

**Risk Level:** Low
- Single commit removing invalid file
- No history rewriting
- All valid files preserved
- Can be reverted if needed

### Next Steps After Merge

1. All developers should sync their local main:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout main
   git reset --hard origin/main
   ```

2. Feature branches can now be rebased onto main:
   ```bash
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

3. Webhook automation PR can proceed (was blocked by this issue)
