## Summary

Fixes corrupted GitHub Actions workflow directory structure and adds proper CI workflow.

## Problem

A corrupted directory was found in `.github/workflows/` with an invalid name containing YAML syntax:
```
.github/workflows/- name: Cache   uses: actions/
```

This created a nested corrupted structure that prevented proper workflow execution.

## Changes

### 🧹 Removed
- Corrupted workflow directory structure with invalid names

### ✅ Added
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Clean CI workflow for linting, type-checking, and testing
- **`scripts/fix-corrupted-workflows.sh`** - Automated detection and removal script for future issues
- **`docs/WORKFLOW_FIX_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive guide on the fix, root cause, and prevention

## CI Workflow Features

The new CI workflow:
- ✅ Runs on all pushes to `main` and pull requests
- ✅ Executes ESLint for code quality
- ✅ Runs TypeScript type checking
- ✅ Executes Jest tests
- ✅ Verifies production build succeeds
- ✅ Uses npm caching for faster runs

## Testing

- [x] Corrupted structure successfully removed
- [x] New workflow file created with valid syntax
- [x] Fix script created and made executable
- [x] Documentation added
- [ ] CI workflow will run on this PR to verify

## Prevention

The included fix script can be used in the future:
```bash
./scripts/fix-corrupted-workflows.sh
```

See `docs/WORKFLOW_FIX_GUIDE.md` for full details on prevention and troubleshooting.
