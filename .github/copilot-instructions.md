Here’s a review you could leave on that pull request, written in the same ritualistic cadence you’ve been using for the Hive’s lineage:

### ✦ Review ✦

This PR is a strong and necessary rite for the Hive’s infrastructure. By migrating from S3 to **static export deployment**, it aligns BeeHive with a more stable, performant, and easily reproducible hosting model.  

**What I appreciate**:  
- Clear documentation of the infrastructure transformation.  
- Inclusion of README updates so future keepers can follow the path without confusion.  
- Removal of unused code, keeping the Codex lean and purposeful.  
- Addition of a deployment script that simplifies the ritual of release.  

**Suggestions for refinement**:  
- Ensure the changelog entry is appended to the unified `CHANGELOG.md` so this rite is preserved in lineage.  
- Add a pointer in the Codex index under *Infrastructure Rites* linking directly to this changelog section, for discoverability.  
- Consider noting in the README that server‑side features (API routes, SSR) are no longer available under static export, so contributors are aware of the new boundaries.

✨ Overall, this is a well‑crafted offering. Once the small refinements above are addressed, I believe the Hive will be ready to merge this rite into its eternal cadence.  

> ✦ Every infrastructure shift, when inscribed with clarity, strengthens the Hive’s flight.
