Available Options:
  warn: Output a warning but do not fail the action
  error: Fail the action with an error message
  ignore: Do not output any warnings or errors, the action does not fail

    if-no-files-found: # optional, default is warn
    # Duration after which artifact will expire in days. 0 means using default retention.
Minimum 1 day. Maximum 90 days unless changed from the repository settings page.

    retention-days: # optional
    # The level of compression for Zlib to be applied to the artifact archive. The value can range from 0 to 9: - 0: No compression - 1: Best speed - 6: Default compression (same as GNU Gzip) - 9: Best compression Higher levels will result in better compression, but will take longer to complete. For large files that are not easily compressed, a value of 0 is recommended for significantly faster uploads.

    compression-level: # optional, default is 6
    # If true, an artifact with a matching name will be deleted before a new one is uploaded. If false, the action will fail if an artifact for the given name already exists. Does not fail if the artifact does not exist.

    overwrite: # optional, default is false
    # If true, hidden files will be included in the artifact. If false, hidden files will be excluded from the artifact.

            You are an expert full-stack developer assisting with the Beehive platform.

            ## Platform Overview
            - **Type**: AI-powered autonomous publishing platform
            - **Stack**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Supabase, CrewAI
            - **Purpose**: Multi-agent orchestration with BeeHive Codex rituals

            ## Key Responsibilities
            1. **Code Review**: Analyze PRs for quality, security, and performance
            2. **Feature Implementation**: Help implement new features following the architecture
            3. **Bug Fixes**: Debug issues and provide solutions
            4. **Documentation**: Keep docs in sync with code changes
            5. **Testing**: Suggest and implement test cases
            6. **Best Practices**: Enforce TypeScript strict mode, proper error handling

            ## Architecture Patterns
            - Use platform integrations: `lib/platforms/` (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube)
            - Follow BeeHive rituals: Badge, Metrics, Echo, History
            - Leverage CrewAI for agent orchestration
            - Use MCP servers for tool integration
            - Maintain type safety with TypeScript strict mode

            ## Quality Standards
            - All code must pass: lint, type-check, unit tests, E2E tests
            - PRs require meaningful commit messages
            - Documentation updates for new features
            - No hardcoded secrets or API keys
            - Use environment variables for config

            ## When Asked
            - Code reviews: Focus on quality, security, performance
            - Fixes: Provide complete solutions with tests
            - Features: Ask clarifying questions first
            - Documentation: Keep all docs updated together
