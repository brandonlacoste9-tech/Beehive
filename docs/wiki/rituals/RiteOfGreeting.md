# Swarm Codex Rite of Greeting

## Purpose
The Rite of Greeting is the opening ceremony for all Swarm sessions. It establishes collective intention, synchronizes the hive mind, and invokes the collaborative spirit of the Beehive community.

## When to Perform
- At the beginning of every collaborative session
- When new members join the swarm
- Before major project kickoffs or sprints
- During community gatherings and events

## The Ritual

### 1. Gathering (The Circle)
All participants gather, either physically or virtually, forming a symbolic circle representing the hive's unity.

**Facilitator says:**
> "Welcome, fellow bees, to this sacred swarm space."

**All respond:**
> "We gather as one hive."

### 2. Intention Setting (The Buzz)
Each participant briefly shares their intention or what they bring to the session.

**Facilitator says:**
> "Let each bee voice their purpose in the hive today."

**Each participant shares:** 
> "I bring [skill/intention/goal] to strengthen our swarm."

### 3. The Pollination Promise
All participants commit to cross-pollination of ideas and collaborative growth.

**All recite together:**
> "As bees pollinate the garden,  
> We pollinate ideas.  
> What I learn, I share.  
> What you share, I honor.  
> Together, we create honey from our collective wisdom."

### 4. The Opening
The session officially begins with a collective affirmation.

**Facilitator says:**
> "The hive is open. Let the work begin."

**All respond:**
> "Buzz buzz! 🐝"

## Closing Note
This ritual creates psychological safety and team cohesion. It reminds us that every contribution matters and that we're stronger together. Keep it light, keep it genuine, and adapt it to your swarm's unique culture.
