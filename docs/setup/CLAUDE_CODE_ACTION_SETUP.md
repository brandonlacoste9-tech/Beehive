# Claude Code Action Setup Guide

## Overview

The Beehive repository now includes the **Claude Code Action** ‚Äî a GitHub workflow that allows Claude to automatically help with your repository by:
- Answering questions about code
- Implementing features and fixes
- Reviewing PRs and code changes
- Updating documentation
- Running tests and validation

The action is triggered by mentioning `@claude` in PR/issue comments or review comments.

---

## Installation & Configuration

### Step 1: Install the Claude GitHub App

1. Visit: https://github.com/apps/claude
2. Click **"Install"** or **"Configure"**
3. Select your repository (Beehive)
4. Grant the app access to your repository

The app requires these permissions:
- ‚úÖ Read/Write access to Pull Requests
- ‚úÖ Read/Write access to Issues
- ‚úÖ Read/Write access to Contents (code files)

---

### Step 2: Choose Your Authentication Method

You have three options:

#### **Option A: OAuth (Claude Max Subscribers) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED**

Best for Claude Max subscribers with an active subscription.

**Setup Steps**:

1. **Get your OAuth credentials** from Claude:
   ```bash
   # Open Claude in terminal
   claude

   # Login with your Claude Max account
   /login
   ```

2. **Find your credentials**:
   - **macOS**: Search "claude" in Keychain ‚Üí "Show password"
   - **Linux/WSL**: View `~/.claude/.credentials.json`

   You'll find three values:
   - `access_token`
   - `refresh_token`
   - `expires_at` (timestamp)

3. **Add to GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to: **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions**
   - Add these secrets:

   | Secret Name | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `CLAUDE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Your access_token |
   | `CLAUDE_REFRESH_TOKEN` | Your refresh_token |
   | `CLAUDE_EXPIRES_AT` | Your expires_at timestamp |
   | `SECRETS_ADMIN_PAT` | GitHub PAT with `secrets:write` permission |

4. **Create GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Create new token (classic)
   - Check: `repo` and `admin:repo_hook`
   - Copy the token and add as `SECRETS_ADMIN_PAT` secret

**Configuration**:
The workflow file already has OAuth enabled:
```yaml
use_oauth: true
claude_access_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
claude_refresh_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_REFRESH_TOKEN }}
claude_expires_at: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_EXPIRES_AT }}
secrets_admin_pat: ${{ secrets.SECRETS_ADMIN_PAT }}
```

---

#### **Option B: Direct Anthropic API**

Best for standard Anthropic API users.

**Setup Steps**:

1. **Get your API key** from: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. **Add to GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to: **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions**
   - Create secret: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = your API key

**Configuration**:
Update `.github/workflows/claude.yml`:
```yaml
# Comment out OAuth section:
# use_oauth: true
# claude_access_token: ...
# claude_refresh_token: ...
# claude_expires_at: ...
# secrets_admin_pat: ...

# Uncomment this instead:
anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

---

#### **Option C: AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI**

For enterprise users with Bedrock or Vertex AI access.

See official documentation for setup:
- **Bedrock**: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/
- **Vertex AI**: https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs

---

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Be specific with requests
- Mention `@claude` in comments on PRs/issues
- Trust Claude with small, well-defined tasks
- Use for code review, documentation, testing
- Provide context (error logs, screenshots)

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Ask Claude to approve/merge PRs (security limitation)
- Merge Claude's branches without review
- Trust Claude with production deployment
- Ask for tasks outside repository context
- Forget to review changes before merging

### Examples of Good Requests:
```
@claude Can you add unit tests for the publishImage function?

@claude Please update GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md to include
the new deploy workflow we just added.

@claude Review this PR for potential security issues,
especially around API key handling.
```

---

## Customization

### Custom Instructions

The workflow includes custom instructions that tell Claude:
- The project is "Beehive" (AI publishing platform)
- Technology stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, CrewAI)
- Key architectural patterns
- Quality standards (tests, types, docs)

To modify these, edit `.github/workflows/claude.yml`:

```yaml
custom_instructions: |
  You are an expert full-stack developer assisting with the Beehive platform.

  # Add your custom guidance here
  When implementing features:
  - Always use TypeScript strict mode
  - Write tests for new functions
  - Update relevant documentation
```

### Environment Variables

Pass custom env vars to Claude Code execution:

```yaml
claude_env: |
  NODE_ENV: development
  DEBUG: false
  DATABASE_URL: postgres://...
```

---

---

## Security Considerations

‚úÖ **What's Safe**:
- Claude has read-only access to the repository
- Claude can create commits on branches (not merged)
- All changes are pushed to a branch for review
- No direct access to production
- All API keys are handled securely via GitHub Secrets

‚ö†Ô∏è **What Claude Cannot Do**:
- Approve or merge pull requests
- Deploy to production
- Delete branches or files without asking
- Access other repositories
- View CI/CD results or secrets

---

## Troubleshooting

### Action Doesn't Trigger

**Problem**: Mentioned `@claude` but nothing happened

**Solutions**:
1. Check that Claude app is installed: **Settings ‚Üí GitHub Apps**
2. Verify message contains exact trigger: `@claude` (case-sensitive by default)
3. Check that you have write access to repository
4. Review action logs for errors

### Authentication Fails

**Problem**: Action fails with "Authentication error"

**Solutions**:

For OAuth:
- Verify `CLAUDE_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set in secrets
- Check token hasn't expired in `CLAUDE_EXPIRES_AT`
- Ensure `SECRETS_ADMIN_PAT` has `secrets:write` permission

For API key:
- Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in secrets
- Check key is valid at https://console.anthropic.com
- Ensure key has sufficient quota

### Timeout Issues

**Problem**: Action times out before completion

**Solutions**:
- Increase `timeout_minutes` (up to 360 = 6 hours)
- Reduce complexity of the request
- Break large tasks into smaller ones
- Check if Claude is waiting for clarification

---

## Cost Considerations

### OAuth (Claude Max Subscription)
- Uses your subscription tokens
- No additional cost
- Included in your subscription quota

### Direct API
- Charges per token used
- Typical PR review: ~5,000-50,000 tokens
- Feature implementation: ~100,000-500,000 tokens
- Check usage at: https://console.anthropic.com/account/usage

### Cost Optimization
- Use `max_turns: "5"` to limit conversation
- Ask specific, focused questions
- Provide context to reduce token usage
- Review logs to understand token consumption
