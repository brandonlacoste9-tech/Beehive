## Troubleshooting

### Bee-ship Function Fails

1. Check Netlify function logs
2. Verify `BEE_API_URL` and `BEE_API_KEY` set
3. Test Bee API directly:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST $BEE_API_URL/agents/creative/run \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEE_API_KEY" \
     -d '{"seed":"test","platforms":["instagram"]}'
   ```

### Instagram Publish Fails

1. Verify `INSTAGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID` is correct (IG Business Account ID, not username)
2. Check `FB_ACCESS_TOKEN` is long-lived page token
3. Confirm Page ‚Üí Instagram account link in FB Business Manager
4. Test Graph API manually:
   ```bash
   curl "https://graph.facebook.com/v17.0/$INSTAGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID?fields=name,username&access_token=$FB_ACCESS_TOKEN"
   ```

### Supabase Upload Fails

1. Verify `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (not anon key)
2. Check bucket `assets` exists and is public
3. Test upload with Supabase client UI

### Payment Webhook Not Received

1. Check Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Events
2. Verify endpoint URL: `https://<site>.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook`
3. Check webhook signing secret matches `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
4. Use Stripe CLI to test:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook
   ```
