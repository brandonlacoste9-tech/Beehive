# 🌌 Idea Flow Constellation

A symbolic and practical guide to the lifecycle of ideas in the BeeHive. This scroll maps how inspiration becomes contribution, and how every act of creation echoes through the swarm.

## 💤 Dreaming
Where sparks begin. Intuition, curiosity, and mythic resonance guide the earliest visions.
- Examples: spontaneous prompt ideas, UI sketches, naming rituals
- Ritual: Capture in the swarm’s idea board or task voting interface

## 🧪 Experimentation
Rapid prototyping, divergence, and playful failure. The forge is hot.
- Examples: AB-tested hooks, visual motif trials, prompt variants
- Ritual: Branch, build, and share early results with the swarm

## 🛠️ Refinement
Polishing with precision. Feedback loops, scroll-worthy clarity, and communal iteration.
- Examples: PR reviews, changelog prep, UI polish
- Ritual: Annotate, document, and align with swarm cadence

## 📜 Inscription
Codifying the idea into a teachable, auditable artifact.
- Examples: Cookbook entries, onboarding scrolls, README updates
- Ritual: Enshrine in the Codex, link from the Ritual Feed

## 🐝 Contribution
Offering the scroll to the hive. Pull requests, changelogs, and swarm-wide celebration.
- Examples: PR merges, deployment rites, changelog entries
- Ritual: Celebrate in the swarm channel, immortalize in lineage

## 🔁 Lineage
How ideas evolve, fork, and inspire future rituals.
- Examples: Forked scrolls, remix campaigns, legacy preservation
- Ritual: Link back to ancestors, echo forward to descendants
