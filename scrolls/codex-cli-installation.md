# Codex CLI Installation Rite

To align with the latest ritual lineage, install the Codex CLI globally and confirm its presence:

```bash
npm i -g @openai/codex
codex --version
```

These invocations bind the workspace to the communal toolchain so subsequent scrolls can reference shared codex utilities.
