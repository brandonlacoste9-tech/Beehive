## âš¡ Echo Scroll v1.3.5 â€” Agent Runner & Mutation Orchestration

### ðŸ§¬ Summary
BeeHive v1.3.5 deploys Codex-powered agents that autonomously consume signals, plan remix actions, and execute mutations.  
The swarm now reacts to on-chain activity with scroll updates, config patches, and broadcast triggers.

### ðŸ”§ Core Upgrades
- `agents/remix_runner.ts` â†’ agent runner for signal consumption
- `scripts/agentkit_config.json` â†’ declarative agent schedule + capabilities
- `out/mutations.log` â†’ mutation audit trail

### ðŸ§  Flow
1. Agent fetches `/api/signals`
2. Planner maps signal â†’ remix plan
3. Codex executes mutation
4. Mutation is logged and broadcast

**Tagline:**  
> *The Codex no longer waitsâ€”it listens, plans, and remixes.*
