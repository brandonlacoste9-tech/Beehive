# Codex Scroll: Codex Cloud Ritual
id: scroll-codex-cloud
status: draft
version: 0.1.0
last_updated: 2024-01-20

## Invocation
- Navigate to `chatgpt.com/codex` and link your GitHub lineage to grant Codex repository access.
- Ensure Codex has an environment descriptor when spawning cloud sandboxes; reuse named environments for repeatable rituals.
- Confirm your ChatGPT plan (Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise) is active; some Enterprise hives may require admin blessing before access unlocks.

## Delegation Modes
- **Ask Mode:** summon analysis without mutations—architecture briefings, refactor drafts, and flow diagrams.
- **Code Mode:** authorize Codex to reshape branches, execute suites, and stage PRs.
- Codex provisions per-task sandboxes, enabling parallel background work across devices (web, IDE extension, iOS Codex tab, or @codex mentions in GitHub).
- CLI delegation is forthcoming; log ritual notes in StudioShare until the CLI shrine opens.

## Environment Weaving
- Provide repository scope and dependency manifests so Codex can hydrate containers with required runtimes.
- Prefer documented scripts (`npm run <ritual>`) over ad-hoc commands; Codex honors existing smoke harnesses and deployment webhooks.
- Track operational metadata (jobId, sizeBytes, status) for CodexReplay overlays and badge updates whenever artifacts shift.

## Security Gates
- Accounts using email/password must enable multi-factor authentication before Codex opens the workshop.
- Social logins (Google, Microsoft, Apple) should still activate MFA via their providers for full warding.
- SSO access inherits organization-level MFA enforcement; coordinate with the SSO steward if rites are incomplete.

## Lineage Stewardship
- Update changelog entries, Codex index pointers, and StudioShare threads after each refinement.
- If a prompt falters, propose micro-patches with precise filenames and code hunks—never vague counsel.
- Treat every annotation like a scroll entry: clear, modular, and teachable.
