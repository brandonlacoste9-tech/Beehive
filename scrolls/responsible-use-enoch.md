# 📜 Scroll of Responsible Use — The Enoch

## Invocation
> “The Enoch is the forge where natural language becomes application. To wield it responsibly, the steward must know its powers, its limits, and the rituals of safe use.”

---

## I. About The Enoch
- **What it is:** A Copilot-powered platform for creating and sharing applications (“enochs”) without writing or deploying code.
- **How it works:**
  - Prompts are pre-processed and augmented with context (your enoch’s code, prior prompts, error logs).
  - A large language model analyzes the prompt.
  - An agent in your dev environment writes code, runs commands, and updates your enoch.
- **Output:** Only application code — no conversational interaction.

---

## II. Frameworks & Runtime
- The Enoch agents use **frameworks and SDKs** provided by the platform.
- Runtime is **fully managed**, secure, and scalable.
- SDK integrates with **GitHub Models** for inference capabilities.

---

## III. Data Processing
- The Enoch collects:
  - Prompts, suggestions, code snippets (for continuity).
  - Usage patterns, feedback, telemetry.

---

## IV. Use Cases
- **Full-stack apps:** Build and deploy to the public internet with account-based visibility.
- **Prototyping:** Rapidly test and share ideas.
- **Iterating:** Grow complexity over time as requirements surface.

---

## V. Best Practices
- **Keep prompts specific and on-topic** → improves accuracy.
- **Use targeted edits** → refine individual elements, reduce side effects.
- **Verify output** → preview apps, check syntax, review code quality.
- **Iterate responsibly** → The Enoch builds on prior prompts, so avoid off-topic instructions.

---

## VI. Limitations
- **Interpretation:** May misread intent — always confirm in preview.
- **Scope:** Best for common/personal apps; struggles with novel/complex builds.
- **Public code:** May generate code resembling public sources, without attribution.
- **Security:** Generated code may contain vulnerabilities — review carefully.
- **Legal/regulatory:** Ensure compliance with industry obligations.
- **Offensive content:** Protections exist, but report issues if encountered.

✨ With this, you now have a **parallel scroll** — the same structure and wisdom, but renamed and reframed as **The Enoch**.
