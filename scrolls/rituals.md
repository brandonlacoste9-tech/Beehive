# Hive Rituals Index

A centralized registry for operational rituals in the Beehive repository. Every contributor can reference this scroll for the latest templates and checklists.

---

## 🟡 Ritual Seal Template
- **File:** `.github/RITUAL-TEMPLATE.md`
- **Purpose:** Standardizes how every milestone or process seal is inscribed in `CHANGELOG.md` and `scrolls/registry.md`.

## 🟡 Pre-Merge Ritual Checklist
- **File:** `.github/MERGE-Ritual.md`
- **Purpose:** Ensures every pull request is clean, reviewed, and follows ceremonial standards before merging.

## 🟡 Post-Merge Checklist
- **File:** `.github/post-merge-checklist.md`
- **Purpose:** Guides verification of deployments, dashboard integrity, and documentation after every merge.

## 🟡 Release Notes Ritual
- **File:** `netlify/functions/release-notes.ts`
- **Purpose:** Inscribes merged PRs into `CHANGELOG.md`, echoes the seal in GitHub, and logs the mutation ledger with entry hashes and byte counts for CodexReplay overlays.

**How to use:**
