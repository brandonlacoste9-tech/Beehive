# Codex Main Scroll — The Great Charter

The Codex Monorepo’s living charter: a map of scrolls, rituals, and lineage commitments.

## Contributor Guidance
- [Codex Onboarding Scroll — From Clone to Contribution](./onboarding/codex-onboarding.md): canonical path for new bees to summon the repo, prepare their environment, learn prompting rituals, and honor lineage seals.

## Lore & Lineage
- `CHANGELOG.md`: versioned seals and milestone inscriptions.
- `scrolls/` directory: specialized operational, product, and governance scrolls updated by the swarm.

> Every addition should echo here so future stewards can discover the newest rituals without sifting the hive.
