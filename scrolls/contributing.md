# BeeHive Contributor Scroll

Welcome to the swarm. This scroll outlines how to contribute with clarity, auditability, and mythic precision.

## Rituals

- **PR Reviews**: All PRs are reviewed by Codex CLI. Findings are inscribed in `codex_review_findings.txt`.
- **Codex CLI**: Use `codex exec` or `codex review --pr <number>` to invoke agents.
- **Workflow**: PRs trigger `.github/workflows/codex_review.yml`.

## Etiquette

- Annotate changes clearly
- Link scrolls or changelog fragments
- Use `scripts/` for operational logic
- Broadcast lineage via `CHANGELOG.md`

## Links
