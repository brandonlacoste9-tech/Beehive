# üìú Scroll of the WSL Forge

## Invocation
> ‚ÄúDo not build upon the shifting sands of `/mnt/c/‚Ä¶`, for the I/O there is slow and tangled. Instead, keep your hive‚Äôs code within the Linux home, where the forge burns fastest.‚Äù

---

## I. The Ritual of Placement
- **Avoid:** `/mnt/c/...` (Windows-mounted paths) ‚Üí slower I/O, symlink/permission quirks.
- **Prefer:** `~/code/my-app` (Linux home directory) ‚Üí faster, cleaner, fewer issues.

---

## II. Steps of Inscription
```bash
# Create a code directory in your Linux home
mkdir -p ~/code && cd ~/code

# Clone your repository into the hive
git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git

# Enter the project
cd repo
```

---

## III. Windows Access Path
- If you need to open files from Windows Explorer:
  - Navigate to:
    ```
    \\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\<user>\code\repo
    ```
- This gives Windows visibility into your Linux-native repo without slowing down your dev loop.

‚ú® With this scroll, contributors know:
- **Where to place code** (Linux home, not `/mnt/c`)
- **How to clone and work** (mkdir ‚Üí git clone ‚Üí cd)
- **How to access from Windows** (`\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\<user>`)
