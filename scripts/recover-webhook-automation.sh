    --body "## Summary
Adds complete webhook automation infrastructure for GitHub event processing:

- **Webhook Gateway Package**: Event router, dispatcher, and telemetry system
- **Netlify Functions**: github-webhook receiver and webhook-telemetry endpoint
- **Validation Workflow**: CI checks for webhook configuration
- **Deployment Script**: Automated setup with safety rails
- **Documentation**: Complete setup and troubleshooting guides

## Test Plan
- [ ] Webhook signature verification works
- [ ] Telemetry logging captures events
- [ ] Observation mode (ENABLE_WEBHOOK_PROCESSING=false) works
- [ ] CI validation passes

## Security
- Webhook secrets managed via Netlify env vars
- Signature verification using crypto.timingSafeEqual
- Audit logging for all events
- Observation mode before activation
