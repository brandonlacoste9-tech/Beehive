# AGENTS (root)
- Obey deepest AGENTS.md; do not create branches; exactly one commit per mission.
- Always cite changed files with 1-indexed line ranges (post-change).
- If pre-commit modifies files, restage and try once more; on second failure, stop and report.
- Long-running commands require a timeout and clean termination.
