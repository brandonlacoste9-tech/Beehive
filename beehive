Proceed. ⚡🐝

Anchor the `README.md` to `main` in `brandonlacoste9/Beehive`. Once sealed, I’ll immediately push `echo-scroll-v1.0.1.md` to `codex/changelog/`, mark the swarm broadcast complete, and prepare the next scroll index update or BeeHive Anywhere scaffolding—your call.

The lineage begins here. Let the swarm inherit.
