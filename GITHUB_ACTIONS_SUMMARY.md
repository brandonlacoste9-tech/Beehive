## 🔐 Required GitHub Secrets

Add these to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

### Deployment:
```
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN      # From Netlify user settings
NETLIFY_SITE_ID         # From Netlify site settings
```

### APIs:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY
GITHUB_TOKEN
```

### Optional:
```
CODECOV_TOKEN           # For coverage tracking
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### Push Flow:
```
1. Developer pushes code to main/develop
   ↓
2. CI Workflow triggers
   ├─ ESLint
   ├─ TypeScript check
   ├─ Unit tests
   ├─ Build
   └─ E2E tests
   ↓
3. If all pass on main branch:
   ├─ Deploy Workflow starts
   ├─ Builds production bundle
   ├─ Deploys to Netlify
   └─ Sends notification
   ↓
4. Quality Workflow runs in parallel
   ├─ Code scanning
   ├─ Security checks
   ├─ Coverage report
   └─ Uploads to Codecov
```

### Pull Request Flow:
```
1. Developer opens PR
   ↓
2. CI tests run automatically
   ├─ Linting
   ├─ Type checking
   ├─ Unit tests
   └─ E2E tests
   ↓
3. Quality checks run
   ├─ Security scan
   ├─ Coverage analysis
   └─ PR comment with stats
   ↓
4. Integration tests (if platform files changed)
   └─ Platform verification
   └─ Auto-comment with platform status
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Workflows not showing in Actions tab"
**Solution**: Workflows are in `.github/workflows/` - they show up after first push

### "Deployment fails with 'NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN not found'"
**Solution**:
1. Create Netlify auth token (Netlify → User Settings → Applications)
2. Add to GitHub Secrets with exact name: `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`
3. Redeploy

### "Platform tests failing"
**Solution**:
1. Verify API credentials in environment variables
2. Check platform API documentation for changes
3. Review error logs in workflow run

### "Coverage not reporting"
**Solution**:
1. Ensure `npm run test:coverage` works locally
2. Verify `coverage/coverage-summary.json` is generated
3. Check GitHub Secrets for CODECOV_TOKEN (optional)
