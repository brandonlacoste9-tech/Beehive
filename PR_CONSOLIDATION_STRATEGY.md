## Consolidation Action Plan

### Phase 1: Duplicate Resolution (5 mins)
```bash
# 1. Close PR #33 (duplicate revert)
gh pr close 33 -c "Duplicate of #32. Consolidated into single PR."

# 2. Review #24 vs #25 - keep one, close other
# These both implement CI/CD - need to compare and consolidate
```

### Phase 2: Merge High-Priority (15 mins)
```bash
# Infrastructure improvements
gh pr merge 25 --auto  # CI/CD with security
gh pr merge 36 --auto  # /status telemetry page

# Features
gh pr merge 22 --auto  # Phase-2 features
gh pr merge 19 --auto  # Beehive integration
gh pr merge 18 --auto  # Telemetry/codex fixes
```

### Phase 3: Merge Medium-Priority (10 mins)
```bash
# Documentation & Codex
gh pr merge 14 --auto  # CODEOWNERS
gh pr merge 13 --auto  # Codex docs
gh pr merge 11 --auto  # Codex artifacts
gh pr merge 16 --auto  # README
gh pr merge 38 --auto  # Copilot instructions
gh pr merge 15 --auto  # JSON helper refactor
```

### Phase 4: Auto-Merge Dependencies (5 mins)
```bash
# Dependencies
gh pr merge 4 --auto   # @netlify/blobs
gh pr merge 7 --auto   # @types/node
```

### Phase 5: Close/Evaluate Non-Critical (5 mins)
```bash
# Evaluate for closure
gh pr close 12 -c "Redundant with #19 (Beehive integration)"
gh pr close 21 -c "Defer: npm publishing not needed for current scope"
gh pr close 23 -c "Reverted by #32. CodeQL deferred."
```

### Phase 6: Monitor WIP
```bash
# Keep monitoring
# PR #9 - Sensory cortex agent mode (WIP)
#   - Check back in 1 week
#   - Close if abandoned
```

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Merge conflicts | Medium | Medium | Test each merge sequentially |
| Lost functionality | Low | High | Review each PR before merge |
| Reverted CodeQL | High | Low | Keep #32, understand why CodeQL was problematic |
| #22 conflicts | Medium | High | Review Phase-2 integration carefully |
| #19 conflicts | Medium | High | Integration with main might have issues |

## Recommendation Summary

âœ… **PROCEED with phased consolidation:**

1. **Immediate** (0-5 mins): Close duplicate #33
2. **Quick** (5-15 mins): Merge infrastructure & features
3. **Follow-up** (15-25 mins): Merge documentation & dependencies
4. **Monitor** (ongoing): Track WIP #9

This will reduce open PRs from 20+ to ~2, giving you a clean slate for Phase 2.2 development.
