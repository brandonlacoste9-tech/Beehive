### 🐝 Beehive Ignition: Dual‑Artifact Ritual

This PR consolidates the ignition workflow into a **production‑ready ritual** that now leaves behind **two artifacts** on every run:

- ✅ **Codex logging** → appends timestamped lore entries into `codex.md`  
- ✅ **Telemetry logging** → appends structured JSONL records into `telemetry/ignitions.jsonl`

---

### 🔹 Why This Matters
- **Codex.md** = human‑readable swarm history (mythic continuity)  
- **Telemetry JSONL** = machine‑readable metrics (operational visibility)  
- Together, they form the **dual‑artifact ritual**: every ignition is both immortalized and measurable.

---

### 🔹 Complete Workflow

```yaml
name: Beehive Ignition

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  swarm-pulse:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Announce ignition
        run: echo "🐝 Beehive ignition sequence started"

      - name: Run smoke test
        run: echo "✅ Swarm is alive and executing communal jobs"

      - name: Codex entry
        run: |
          echo "### $(date -u) — Beehive ignition successful 🐝" >> codex.md
          git config user.name "beehive-runner"
          git config user.email "runner@beehive.local"
          git add codex.md
          git commit -m "Codex: ignition entry [skip ci]" || echo "No changes to commit"
          git push

      - name: Emit telemetry
        run: |
          mkdir -p telemetry
          echo "{\"event\":\"ignition\",\"status\":\"success\",\"timestamp\":\"$(date -u +%FT%TZ)\",\"runner\":\"$RUNNER_NAME\",\"workflow_run_id\":\"$GITHUB_RUN_ID\"}" >> telemetry/ignitions.jsonl
          git add telemetry/ignitions.jsonl
          git commit -m "Telemetry: ignition pulse [skip ci]" || echo "No changes to commit"
          git push
```

---

### 🔹 Expected Output

After each workflow run:

**`codex.md`** (human-readable lore):
```markdown
### Wed Oct 08 06:18:00 UTC 2025 — Beehive ignition successful 🐝
```

**`telemetry/ignitions.jsonl`** (machine-readable metrics):
```json
{"event":"ignition","status":"success","timestamp":"2025-10-08T06:18:00Z","runner":"beehive-runner","workflow_run_id":"12345678"}
```

---

### 🔹 Next Steps
1. ✅ Mark this PR **Ready for review**
2. ✅ Merge into `main`
3. ✅ Trigger ignition from **Actions → Beehive Ignition → Run workflow**
4. ✅ Verify both artifacts update

---

### 🔹 Coming Next
Once this is merged and verified, we'll stage **PR #6: Webhook Pulse Integration** so each ignition also broadcasts a live JSON payload to your dashboard or Slack — completing the **triple‑artifact ritual**.
