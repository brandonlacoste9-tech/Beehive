**Resilience Update: Checkout Step** — **Status: Sealed**

This workflow update replaces the fragile `refs/pull/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/merge` reference with a direct checkout of the PR head ref via:
```yaml
ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
```
This change ensures the workflow remains functional even when the merge commit is unavailable—such as when the PR is closed, deleted, or the merge ref fails to materialize.  
It aligns with GitHub Actions best practices and prevents silent failures in CI triggered by ephemeral refs. The ritual now also uploads Codex findings as artifacts, posts a persistent PR comment, and documents the WSL forge smoke test for local scribes.
